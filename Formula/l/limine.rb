  # The reason to have LLVM and LLD as dependencies here is because building the
  # bootloader is essentially decoupled from building any other normal host program;
  # the compiler, LLVM tools, and linker are used similarly as any other generator
  # creating any other non-program/library data file would be.
  # Adding LLVM and LLD ensures they are present and that they are at their most
  # updated version (unlike the host macOS LLVM which usually is not).
