  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      To activate these completions, add the following to your .zshrc:

        if type brew &>/dev/null; then
          FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-completions:$FPATH

          autoload -Uz compinit
          compinit
        fi

      You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:

        rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit

      Additionally, if you receive "zsh compinit: insecure directories" warnings when attempting
      to load these completions, you may need to run this:

        chmod -R go-w '#{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh'
    EOS
  end

  test do
    (testpath/"test.zsh").write <<~EOS
      fpath=(#{pkgshare} $fpath)
      autoload _ack
      which _ack
    EOS
    assert_match(/^_ack/, shell_output("zsh test.zsh"))
  end
end
