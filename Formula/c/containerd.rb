        For most workloads you need to execute the following command to install OCI and CNI:
          brew install runc cni-plugins

        To run containerd as the current user, execute the following commands:
          brew install nerdctl rootlesskit slirp4netns
          containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install

        To run containerd as the root user, use `brew services` with `sudo --preserve-env=HOME`.

    on_macos do
      caveats = <<~EOS
        The macOS version of containerd does not natively support running containers.
        You need to install an additional runtime plugin such as nerdbox (not packaged in Homebrew yet)
        to run containers on this build of containerd.

        To run the Linux native version of containerd in Linux Machine (Lima), execute the following commands:
          brew install lima
          limactl start
      EOS
