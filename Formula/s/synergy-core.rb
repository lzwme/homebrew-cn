  # The synergy-core/LICENSE file contains the following preamble:
  #   This program is released under the GPL with the additional exemption
  #   that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed.
  # This preamble is followed by the text of the GPL-2.0.
  #
  # The synergy-core license is a free software license but it cannot be
  # represented with the brew `license` statement.
  #
  # The GitHub Licenses API incorrectly says that this project is licensed
  # strictly under GPLv2 (rather than GPLv2 plus a special exception).
  # This requires synergy-core to appear as an exception in:
  #   audit_exceptions/permitted_formula_license_mismatches.json
  # That exception can be removed if the nonfree GitHub Licenses API is fixed.

  # to worry about missing a new 2.0.0 version in the future.

    # The binaries built by brew are not signed by a trusted certificate, so the
    # user may need to revoke all permissions for 'Accessibility' and re-grant
    # them when upgrading synergy-core.
    on_macos do
      s += "\n" + <<~EOS
        Synergy requires the 'Accessibility' permission.
        You can grant this permission by navigating to:
          System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility

        If Synergy still doesn't work, try clearing the 'Accessibility' list:
          sudo tccutil reset Accessibility
        You can then grant the 'Accessibility' permission again.
        You may need to clear this list each time you upgrade synergy-core.
      EOS
      # On ARM, macOS is even more picky when dealing with applications not signed
      # by a trusted certificate, and, for whatever reason, both the app bundle and
      # the actual executable binary need to be granted the permission by the user.
      # (On Intel macOS, only the app bundle needs to be granted the permission.)
      #
      # This is particularly unfortunate because the operating system will prompt
      # the user to grant the permission to the app bundle, but will *not* prompt
      # the user to grant the permission to the executable binary, even though the
      # application will not actually work without doing both. Hence, this caveat
      # message is important.
      on_arm do
        s += "\n" + <<~EOS
          On ARM macOS machines, the 'Accessibility' permission must be granted to
          both of the following two items:
            (1) #{opt_prefix}/bundle/Synergy.app
            (2) #{opt_bin}/synergy
