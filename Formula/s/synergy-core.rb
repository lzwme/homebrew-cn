  # The synergy-core/LICENSE file contains the following preamble:
  #   This program is released under the GPL with the additional exemption
  #   that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed.
  # This preamble is followed by the text of the GPL-2.0.
  #
  # The synergy-core license is a free software license but it cannot be
  # represented with the brew `license` statement.
  #
  # The GitHub Licenses API incorrectly says that this project is licensed
  # strictly under GPLv2 (rather than GPLv2 plus a special exception).
  # This requires synergy-core to appear as an exception in:
  #   audit_exceptions/permitted_formula_license_mismatches.json
  # That exception can be removed if the nonfree GitHub Licenses API is fixed.

  # This repository contains old 2.0.0 tags, one of which uses a stable tag

  # The `GithubLatest` strategy is used to avoid these old tags without having
  # to worry about missing a new 2.0.0 version in the future.

        Synergy requires the 'Accessibility' permission.
        You can grant this permission by navigating to:
          System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility

        If Synergy still doesn't work, try clearing the 'Accessibility' list:
          sudo tccutil reset Accessibility
        You can then grant the 'Accessibility' permission again.
        You may need to clear this list each time you upgrade synergy-core.
