  # The leading `v` in this regex is intentionally non-optional, as we need to
  # exclude a few older tags that use a different version scheme and would
  # erroneously appear as newer than the newest version. We can't check the
  # "latest" release on GitHub because it's sometimes a lower version that was
  # released after a higher version (i.e., "latest" is the most recent release
  # but not necessarily the newest version in this context).
