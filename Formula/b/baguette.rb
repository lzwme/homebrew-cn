    # Build the iOS-Simulator virtual-camera dylib from source rather than
    # using the prebuilt copy in the tarball. Mirrors upstream's
    # VirtualCamera/build.sh, compiled against the iphonesimulator SDK for this
    # formula's arch (arm64) straight into the SPM resource directory.
    # `-target *-simulator` stamps the iOS-Simulator platform load command and
    # `-Wl,-adhoc_codesign` ad-hoc signs the dylib at link time. Homebrew
    # re-signs it during relocation, which is fine: at runtime baguette copies
    # the dylib to a fresh content-hashed path before injecting it, so the
    # simulator's dyld loads the ad-hoc signature without the page-hash-cache
    # "invalid-page" rejection that only hits a replaced dylib at the same path.
