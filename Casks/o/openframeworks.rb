  # Sometimes the "latest" release on GitHub is a `latest` tag that doesn't
  # correspond to a version. This checks the first-party download page, which
  # links to the newest versioned macOS file from GitHub, as this is lighter
  # than using the `GithubReleases` strategy to check multiple recent releases.
