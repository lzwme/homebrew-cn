  # The Sparkle feed contents varies based on the provided [macOS] `system`
  # value (e.g., 1441 for 14.4.1) and we only receive an older version if we
  # omit it. If we use a hardcoded `system` value, eventually the `livecheck`
  # block can get stuck on an older version until the `system` value is updated
  # to a newer macOS version. To avoid this, we simply check the versions listed
  # on the related Support Center page.
