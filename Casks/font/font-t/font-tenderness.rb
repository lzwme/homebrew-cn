  # the homepage has an empty HTML comment between the leading "Version" text
  # and the version (e.g. `Version <!-- -->1.2.3`). This uses a loose regex to
  # work around this issue but it could lead to unexpected matches, so we may
  # want to keep an eye on this situation and make this regex more strict in
  # the future when possible.
