  # A tag using the stable version format is sometimes marked as "Pre-release"
  # on the GitHub releases page, so we have to check releases instead of tags.
  # Versions with suffixes like `0.7.2.6-sqlite-fix` are also a problem when
  # using the `Git` strategy, as the suffix is compared alphabetically (so a
  # newer version may wrongly appear to be older). Newer releases may not
  # provide a macOS asset, so this uses the `GithubReleases` strategy until
  # upstream consistently provides macOS files. The regex is currently very
  # loose and ambiguous because it's not clear what the file name format will
  # be going forward (after several years without a new version) but we should
  # tighten it up if/when the format becomes more clear in the future.
