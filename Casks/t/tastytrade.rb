  # The version information is found in a random JSON file, which is referenced
  # from another JSON file. We can't tell which file will contain the version
  # information, so we check each until we find a match. As of writing, the
  # first JSON file contains the version information but this check could
  # involve further requests if the order of the JSON files changes or the
  # structure of the target JSON file changes. The latter would cause the check
  # to fetch all the JSON files before failing, which isn't ideal.
