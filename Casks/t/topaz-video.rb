  # Unlike the previous version of this app (topaz-video-ai), the .pkg installer does not contain
  # supplementary packages to install the plugins. Additionally, the app does not contain the menu
  # options for the user to manually install the plugins post-installation. Until this is resolved
  # by the vendor, trigger the plugin installation scripts here so the end state is a ready-to-use
  # installation as per the previous version users are likely to be transitioning from.
